Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. (hyonk) A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. (hyonk) Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. [y]"
